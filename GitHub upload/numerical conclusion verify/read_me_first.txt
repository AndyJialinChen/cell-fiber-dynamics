Numerical-verification suite for  
“Phase Difference Dynamics of an Actin Polymerization Cell–Fiber System”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QUICK START
-----------
1.  Create a Python ≥3.9 environment with  
      numpy, scipy, pandas, tqdm, openpyxl (for .xlsx I/O).
    Example (conda):  `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2.  Clone / download this folder and **one level up** place
    `ode_steady_analysis.xlsx` (generated by C1).
3.  Run verifications:

      python C1_verify.py                   # 5⁴ grid, writes ode_steady_analysis.xlsx
      python C2_verify.py                   # direction-consistency
      python C3_verify.py                   # monotone-before-plateau (uses C1 output)
      python C4_verify.py                   # post-steady stability (self-contained)
      python C5_verify.py                   # first-zero termination (uses C1 output)
      python supplementary_7x5_grid.py      # 7⁵ grid incl. *b* sweep

    All scripts are embarrassingly parallel; they auto-detect CPU cores.

FILE MAP
--------
| Script                                   | Purpose / notes                                       |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **C1_verify.py**                         | 5⁴ grid (δ₀, p₁, p₂, a) → verifies C1, outputs `ode_steady_analysis.xlsx` |
| **C2_verify.py**                         | Directional consistency (C2) – *independent*           |
| **C3_verify.py**                         | Pre-steady monotonicity (C3) – re-integrates rows from C1 |
| **C4_verify.py**                         | Post-steady drift test (C4) – fully self-contained      |
| **C5_verify.py**                         | First-zero termination (C5) – uses C1 output           |
| **supplementary_7x5_grid.py**            | 7⁵ sweep over (δ₀,p₁,p₂,a,b) → repeats C1,C3,C5 with *b* variation |
| `ode_steady_analysis.xlsx` (parent dir)  | Main 5⁴ dataset consumed by C3 & C5                    |
| `supplementary_analysis_vary_p1p2abdelta.xlsx` | Full 7⁵ dataset produced by the supplementary sweep |

WHY *b* IS NOT VARIED IN THE MAIN C1/C3/C5 SCRIPTS
--------------------------------------------------
* **Biological / mathematical context** – Both semi-axes *a* and *b*
  independently affect the non-linear term in  
  \(f(\delta)=d\Psi/dt-d\Theta/dt\), so two ellipses with identical aspect
  ratio may still have different dynamics.

* **Early-stage code legacy** – The C1, C3 and C5 scripts were written
  before we recognised this and therefore fix **b = 1**.  This does **not**
  invalidate the empirical checks; it merely reduces the size of the test
  set.

* **Supplementary compensation** – The `supplementary_7x5_grid.py`
  script performs a 16 807-point sweep jointly varying *b*, confirming that
  C1, C3 and C5 continue to hold when *b* is allowed to change.  C2 and C4
  are intrinsically *b*-agnostic (C2 analyses the sign structure of
  \(f\), C4 examines post-plateau drift) and therefore are **not** rerun in
  the supplementary study.

DATA LOCATIONS
--------------
* `ode_steady_analysis.xlsx` – saved **one directory above** this folder so
  it is shared by multiple scripts without duplication.
* `supplementary_analysis_vary_p1p2abdelta.xlsx` – saved **in this folder**
  alongside the code that generates it.

TIPS
----
* Reduce `DT` or `T_MAX` in a script header for quick smoke tests.
* All scripts tolerate re-running; output files will be overwritten.
* For NYU Greene or similar HPC, wrap each script in a Slurm batch file;
  no container peculiarities—pure Python.
